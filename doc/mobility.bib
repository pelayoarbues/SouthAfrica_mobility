@article{Currie2011,
abstract = {This paper explores trip chaining behaviour of Melbourne residents using evidence from a household travel survey. The research literature has suggested that trip-making behaviour has grown increasingly complex as modern life has become busier and people grow time-poor. Complex trip chains have been said to require flexible travel modes, and for this reason some research has suggested that public transport is limited in this regard compared to the private car. Results of this study show that between 1994 and 1999 the complexity of trip chains was relatively stable and the complexity of chains was found to be larger for rail and tram than for car-based trips. Disaggregate analyses compare the complexity of chains based on work versus non-work chains, the purpose of stops on the chain, and whether the chain entered the central city of Melbourne or not. Overall these findings suggest a less bleak outlook for public transport ridership in a travel future which is said to be becoming more complex.},

@article{Georggi2001,
abstract = {This paper provides a detailed analysis of long-distance travel behavior for two key socioeconomic groups of the population.the elderly and the low income. The analysis utilizes data from the 1995 American Travel Survey that provides a rich source of information on long-distance travel (i.e., trips greater than 100 mi) undertaken over a period of 12 months. The analysis focuses on comparing the elderly and the low-income groups of the population against other groups with respect to various demographic and trips characteristics. The travel behavior comparison includes an analysis by trip purpose, travel mode, distance, trip duration, and trip frequency. In addition, regression models of long-distance trip generation are estimated separately for different groups to examine differences in trip generation propensity across the groups. The results show that both the elderly and the low income undertake significantly fewer long-distance trips than other socioeconomic groups. It was found that nearly half of the low income and elderly made no long-distance trips in the 1-year survey period. In addition, it was found that long-distance trips made by these groups were more likely to be undertaken by bus and geared towards social and personal business activities. The paper discusses the implications of these findings in the context of transportation service provision and policy formulation.},

@article{Hausman1984,
abstract = {Discrete choice models are now used in a variety of situations in applied econometrics. By far the model specification which is used most often is the multinomial logit model. Yet it is widely known that a potentially important drawback of the multinomial logit model is the independence from irrelevant alternatives property. While most analysts recognize the implications of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property, it has remained basically a maintained assumption in applications. In the paper we provide two sets of computationally convenient specification tests for the multinomial logit model. The first test is an application of the Hausman 10 specification test procedure. The basic idea for the test here is to test the reverse implication of the independence from irrelevant alternatives property. The test statistic is easy to compute since it only requires computation of a quadratic form which involves the difference of the parameter estimates and the differences of the estimated covariance matrices. The second set of specification tests that we propose is based on more classical test procedures. We consider a generalization of the multinomial logit model which is called the nested logit model. Since the multinomial logit model is a special case of the more general model when a given parameter equals one, classical test procedures such as the Wald, likelihood ratio, and Lagrange multiplier tests can be used. The two sets of specification test procedures care then compared for an example where exact and approximate comparisons are possible.},

abstract = {Spatial Analysis: Modelling in a GIS Environment Edited by Paul Longley and Michael Batty Digital data and information are used increasingly by academics, professionals, local authorities, and government departments. Powerful new technologies, such as geographic information systems (GIS), are being developed to analyse such data, and GIS technologies are rapidly becoming part of the emergent world digital infrastructure. This book shows how computer methods of analysis and modelling, built around GIS, can be used to identify ways in which our cities and regions might be better planned and understood. The contributors to this book are all actively involved in research using geographic information systems. This book will be valuable reading for:* Geographers, researchers, and regional analysts* Population theorists and regional economists with interests in large-scale demographic and employment data* Planners and policy-makers who wish to use GIS to improve their decision making* Business analysts who wish to explore markets using the most recent advances in digital spatial data technology* All those interested in geodemographicsPaul Longley is Professor of Geography at the Department of Geography, University of Bristol, United Kingdom.

@article{Krygsman2007,
abstract = {It is generally assumed that the choice of transport mode and the choice of including intermediate activities on a work tour are interrelated, but little is known about the nature of the causal relationship. To shed light on this, this paper addresses the question of whether transport mode choice is dependent on the activity choice or vice-versa. A new methodology, referred to as the co-evolutionary approach, is combined with a set of MNL models, one for each choice facet involved, to derive an indication of the order of decisions on an individual level. The models are estimated based on the work tours of a large sample of individuals in the Netherlands. The results suggest that there is substantial variation in the order of the transport mode and activity decisions. However, in the majority of cases the activity decision is made before the mode decision, suggesting that the transport mode and, in particular, the choice between car and public transport is most often ‘adjusted’ to the choice of trip chaining rather than the other way round.},

@article{Mallett2001,
abstract = {Local transportation mobility problems among low-income households are relatively well researched, but much less is known about intercity (or long-distance) travel by these households. While not as important as daily local travel, long-distance trips are often necessary to visit distant family and friends-sometimes to take care of them-to attend family functions such as weddings and funerals, and for rest and relaxation, sightseeing, and other personal recreational and developmental needs. Such travel is particularly acute around the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's holidays. Business travel is another important component of long-distance travel. The dearth of research on long-distance travel derives in part from lack of data, a problem overcome with results from the 1995 American Travel Survey (ATS). Conducted for the Bureau of Transportation Statistics by the Bureau of the Census, the ATS collected information on the origin, destination, volume, and characteristics of long-distance travel from approximately 80,000 households in the United States in 1995. This paper examines the long-distance travel behavior of low-income households in comparison with higher income households using the ATS. The paper begins with a description of how households were classified into income groups and the demographic and geographical characteristics of low-income people. This is followed by an analysis of the travel behavior of individuals from low-income households. Because a disproportionate share of people in low-income households are children and the elderly (65 or older) and these groups travel less than adults under 65, the paper includes a separate examination of adults under 65, adults 65 and older, and children.},

Its essential conceptual contribution lies in its explicit treatment of the processes making perfect predictions of choice behavior unattainable. The paper's technical contribution is its demonstration of the manner in which these processes induce the distributional properties of a model. In contrast to the approach adopted here, the existing literature on random utility models generally imposes distributional assumptions directly. Because it leaves so much implicit, this practice has often caused researchers to remain unaware of the restrictiveness of their models. Only a few authors, working with specific simple models, have chosen to lay the foundations of their research more deeply. Their efforts will be described shortly.},

abstract = {Rapid demographic aging in countries around the world has prompted an interest in understanding the mobility patterns of seniors. While much research has been conducted in terms of motorized modes, the promotion of healthy aging argues for new research to investigate the multi-modal travel behavior of seniors including active travel. The objective of this paper is to investigate the factors that influence the use of two motorized and one active mode of transportation, and their corresponding trip length. A joint discrete–continuous modeling framework allows us to examine the tendency to travel by different modes using a multinomial structure, and trip length using a hazard formulation. Data are drawn from Montreal’s Household Travel Survey of 2008. A broad array of covariates related to individual and household attributes and urban form are used. The results of the analysis reveal a significant degree of geographical variability in the travel behavior of seniors in Montreal. In particular, estimates for seniors with different socio-economic and demographic profiles show substantial intra-urban variability in walking behavior, and the role of neighborhood design attributes in influencing the mobility of seniors.},

abstract = {The trip timing and mode choice are two critical decisions of individual commuters mostly define peak period traffic congestion in urban areas. Due to the increasing evidence in many North American cities that the duration of the congested peak travelling periods is expanding (peak spreading), it becomes necessary and natural to investigate these two commuting decisions jointly. In addition to being considered jointly with mode choice decisions, trip timing must also be modelled as a continuous variable in order to precisely capture peak spreading trends in a policy sensitive transportation demand model. However, in the literature to date, these two fundamental decisions have largely been treated separately or in some cases as integrated discrete decisions for joint investigation. In this paper, a discrete-continuous econometric model is used to investigate the joint decisions of trip timing and mode choice for commuting trips in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The joint model, with a multinomial logit model for mode choice and a continuous time hazard model for trip timing, allows for unrestricted correlation between the unobserved factors influencing these two decisions. Models are estimated by occupation groups using 2001 travel survey data for the GTA. Across all occupation groups, strong correlations between unobserved factors influencing mode choice and trip timing are found. Furthermore, the estimated model proves that it sufficiently captures the peak spreading phenomenon and is capable of being applied within the activity-based travel demand model framework.},

@book{Rabe-Hesketh2012,
abstract = {Multilevel and Longitudinal Modeling Using Stata, Second Edition discusses regression modeling of clustered or hierarchical data, such as data on students nested in schools, patients in hospitals, or employees in firms. Longitudinal data are also clustered with, for instance, repeated measurements on patients or several panel waves per survey respondent. Multilevel and longitudinal modeling can exploit the richness of such data and can disentangle processes operating at different levels. Assuming some knowledge of linear regression, this bestseller explains models and their assumptions, applies methods to real data using Stata, and shows how to interpret the results. The applications and exercises span a wide range of disciplines, making the book suitable for courses on multilevel and longitudinal modeling in the medical, social, and behavioral sciences and in applied statistics. This extensively revised second edition includes 3 new chapters, comprehensive updates for Stata 10, 38 new exercises, and 27 new data sets. The authors teach multilevel and longitudinal modeling at their universities and frequently hold workshops at international conferences. They have been developing a general modeling framework, GLLAMM, and Stata software gllamm for multilevel and latent variable modeling. This work has been published in their highly acclaimed book Generalized Latent Variable Modeling: Multilevel, Longitudinal, and Structural Equation Models and in many journals, including Biometrics, Psychometrika, Journal of Econometrics, and Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.},

abstract = {GaussHermite quadrature is often used to evaluate and maximize the likelihood for random component probit models. Unfortunately, the estimates are biased for large cluster sizes and/or intraclass correlations. We show that adaptive quadrature largely overcomes these problems. We then extend the adaptive quadrature approach to general random coefficient models with limited and discrete dependent variables. The models can include several nested random effects (intercepts and coefficients) representing unobserved heterogeneity at different levels of a hierarchical dataset. The required multivariate integrals are evaluated efficiently using spherical quadrature rules. Simulations show that adaptive quadrature performs well in a wide range of situations.},

@article{Rietveld2000,
abstract = {Non-motorised transport modes such as walking and biking are environmentally friendly, cheap and reasonably fast alternatives for trips up to a distance of some 3.5 km. Their importance for longer trips follows when a multimodal perspective is used: the use of the car implies short walking trips to a parking place. For public transport the same holds true for walking and biking to a public transport stop. Recognition of the multimodal character of these trips means that the number of moves made by pedestrians increases with a factor of about 6; the increase in distance is about 40\%. Implications are discussed for average travel speeds, daily travel-time budgets, parking policies and policies to stimulate public transport.},

@article{Sasic2013,
abstract = {The paper presents an econometric model for departure time choice modelling. The proposed model is a discrete choice model with latent choice sets. As per the formulation of the mode, the model falls in the general category of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) models with choice set formation, which is also known as a Generalized Logit (GenL) model. However, the proposed modelling framework uses a scale parameterization approach to capture heteroskedasticity in departure time choices. Hence, the model presented in the paper is a Heteroskedastic Generalized Logit (Het-GenL) model in general or specifically a heteroskedastic Paired Combinatorial Logit Model (Het-PCL). Empirical models are developed for the departure time choices for home-based commuting trips in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). The datasets from the Transportation Tomorrow Survey, a 5 percent household based trip diary survey conducted in 2006 is used for empirical model estimation. Separate models are estimated for private car and transit users’ departure time choices. It becomes evident that transportation level-of-service attributes enter into the systematic utility function as well as the scale parameter function with significant coefficients. The proposed econometric approach captures the normalization effect of different variables in terms of simultaneously influencing systematic utility as well as the scale parameter and thereby correctly explains the elasticity of corresponding variables.},

abstract = {This research aims at gaining a better understanding about time and space related determinants, which are generally acknowledged to be important factors in the choice of transport mode. The effect of trip chaining is taken into account to improve the insight in the relation between the choice of transport mode and time factors. The data source is the first large scale Belgian mobility survey, carried out in 1998–1999, complemented with a newly created database, containing for each trip a calculated public transport trip. This allows comparing for each trip the actual travel time with the calculated travel time by public transport. Using elasticities and regression techniques the relation between travel time components and public transport use is quantified. On trip level, a clear relation is found between waiting and walking time and public transport use. On trip chain level, travel time variables for the whole trip chain such as the maximum and the range in the travel time ratio provide a significant improvement to the explanatory power of the regression model. The results contain parameters for model input and recommendations to public transport companies on information provision, intermodality and supply.},

@article{Vermunt2008,
abstract = {An extension of latent class (LC) and finite mixture models is described for the analysis of hierarchical data sets. As is typical in multilevel analysis, the dependence between lower-level units within higher-level units is dealt with by assuming that certain model parameters differ randomly across higher-level observations. One of the special cases is an LC model in which group-level differences in the logit of belonging to a particular LC are captured with continuous random effects. Other variants are obtained by including random effects in the model for the response variables rather than for the LCs. The variant that receives most attention in this article is an LC model with discrete random effects: higher-level units are clustered based on the likelihood of their members belonging to the various LCs. This yields a model with mixture distributions at two levels, namely at the group and the subject level. This model is illustrated with three rather different empirical examples. The appendix describes an adapted version of the expectation-maximization algorithm that can be used for maximum likelihood estimation, as well as providing setups for estimating the multilevel LC model with generally available software.},

@article{Ye2007,
abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between mode choice and the complexity of trip chaining patterns. An understanding of the causality between these two choice behaviors may aid in the development of tour-based travel demand modeling systems that attempt to incorporate models of trip chaining and mode choice. The relationship between these two aspects of travel behavior is represented in this paper by considering three different causal structures: one structure in which the trip chaining pattern is determined first and influences mode choice, another structure in which mode choice is determined first and influences the complexity of the trip chaining pattern, and a third structure in which neither is predetermined but both are determined simultaneously. The first two structures are estimated within a recursive bivariate probit modeling framework that accommodates error covariance. The simultaneous logit model is estimated for the third structure that allows a bidirectional simultaneous causality. The analysis and model estimation are performed separately for work tour and non-work tour samples drawn from the 2000 Swiss Microcensus travel survey. Model estimation results show that the causal structure in which trip chain complexity precedes mode choice performs best for both work and non-work tour samples. The structure in which mode choice precedes trip chaining pattern choice was found to give significantly inferior goodness-of-fit measures. These findings have important implications for the development of activity-based and tour-based modeling systems and for the design and planning of public transport systems.},
